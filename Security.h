* Security.h
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This code implements the locking and unlocking of various levels of write 
* protection. It uses the SHA256 hash function to store and verify passwords. 
* The Basic write-protection lock is disabled (unlocked) by default, and 
* when unlocked it allows the user to change a handful of innocuous 
* variables/registers that won't get your typical operator into trouble. 
* "Tech"-level write protection, when unlocked, allows for the modification 
* of most variables we expect the customer may want to change. 
* "Factory" unlock allows overwriting many variables that we typically do not 
* want customers to ever change, such as the Model Code of their analyzer. 
* These write protections are unlocked by writing the appropriate password to 
* REG_UNLOCK_PASS[0-2] as an ASCII-coded character string and then forcing the 
* appropriate coil ("COIL_UNLOCK_XXXXX") to logic high. The password fields 
* will then be cleared regardless of whether the password was accepted or denied.
